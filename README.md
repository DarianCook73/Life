Game of Life - AB23 - Lab Assignment
------------------------------------

Overview
--------
  Game of Life is a program that simulates the actions of bacteria
  on a grid. Each space on the grid contains a piece of bacteria that
  will either become alive or dead depending on the Life100.txt file
  that is imported. After applying certain critera in the form of 
  decision strucutres the grid will become "alive"

Coding Application
------------------
  In this assignment, we use 2-Dimensional (2D) arrays to parse through
  a source file to receive input. We used 2D arrays, decision structures,
  loops, classes, documentation, scanners, importation, array parsing,
  and constructors
